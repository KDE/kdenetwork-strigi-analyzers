This is a meta information plugin for BitTorrent files (*.torrent).

It doesn't depend on BitTorrent or any non-standard library being installed.

The .torrent files used by BitTorrent are coded in what is called a b-encoding
by the BitTorrent author.  Please see the actual kfile plugin source code for
more information on the encoding.
